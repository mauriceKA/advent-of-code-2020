... in the world's most underestimated programming language: JavaScript

I've been wondering what people use to sovle these puzzles. When you google, you find a wide variety of approaches (even Google Spreadheets).

Most people seem to use Python. However, is there any programming language that is more obiquitous than JavaScript? You can use it to create front-end code (for the browsers) or back-end code (running e.g. in node or deno). 

You have the plumbing everywhere. To run my solutions, all you need is to open the dev tools of this browser and paste the whole file into the console. Everything is self-contained - no need to install anything else. 

Can your puzzle solutions offer that as well?
